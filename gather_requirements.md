# Gather requirements

As with all projects, you must begin by gathering requirements. In this stage, you're answering the question:

> What does the distribution need to do?

We strongly recommend using an agile methodology to drive this process. E.g., consider user personas, define requirements as user stories, etc. Some specific suggestions:

* _Communicate_ your intended users to determine which features are most important to them.
* Draft requirements from the user perspective
* Consider all user roles/personas. E.g., both the administrative users and the end/public   user.

A few example requirements that you may discover include:

* "We require Press Room that displays all press releases on the website."
* "Users must be able to comment on press releases."

These requirements will later be converted into user stories, which together describe the distributions features. Those will subsequently be sized, scheduled, and ultimately analyzed for implementation.

#### Common mistakes at this stage:

* Defining requirements in a vacuum without speaking to intended users.
* Designing the wireframes and mockups before gathering requirements.
* Designing the application architecture before gathering requirements
* Defining implementation details rather than requirements. E.g., stating "we need a press release content type" rather than "We need a page that aggregates all press releases."
