# Gather requirements

As with all projects, you must begin by gathering requirements. In this stage, you're answering the question:

> What does the distribution need to do?

We strongly recommend using an agile methodology to drive this process. In this guide, we will use agile terminology such as "[user story](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/delivery-vehicles)" and "[epic](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/delivery-vehicles)" to refer to specific forms of requirements and features. Please see linked materials for more information.

In the initial requirements gathering (sometimes called Discovery) phase you will primarily be performing research and asking questions. Some specific suggestions for this phase include:

* Determine who your users and consider all user roles/personas. E.g., both the administrative users and the end/public user.
* _Communicate_ your intended users. Ask them questions. 
  * Identify existing pain points
  * Ask which features they need and/or want.
* Meticulously document your findings.
* Gain a sense of existing expectations.
* Foster a spirit of involvement and stewardship in your users.

A few example requirements that you may discover include:

* "We require Press Room that displays all press releases on the website."
* "Users must be able to comment on press releases."

These requirements will later be converted into user stories, taken en masse will describe the distributions features. They will subsequently be sized, scheduled, analyzed, and developed.

Please note that we have not yet considered wireframes, designs, or implementation details. Those tasks will be completed later.

#### Common mistakes at this stage:

* Defining requirements in a vacuum without speaking to intended users.
* Designing the wireframes and mockups before gathering requirements.
* Designing the application architecture before gathering requirements
* Defining implementation details rather than requirements. E.g., stating "we need a press release content type" rather than "We need a page that aggregates all press releases."
