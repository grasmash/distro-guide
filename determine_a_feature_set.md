# Determine a feature set

As a distribution owner, you must analyze all of the requirements and potential features in order to determine which are appropriate for inclusion in the distribution.

Consider the following questions for each feature:

* Will this feature be used widely across many sites?
* Can this feature be easily toggled on and off? 
* How flexible and configurable should this feature be?
* Does this feature have security or performance consequences?
* Does benefit of having this feature warrant the level of effort required for development?

The answers to these questions will determine prioritization, schedule, and ultimately which features are included.

### Translate requirements into user stories

Requirements for planned features should be translated into user stories [user stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/delivery-vehicles) which are grouped into [epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/delivery-vehicles). 

Take our previous two example requirements:
* "We require Press Room that displays all press releases on the website."
* "Users must be able to comment on press releases."

These would be translated into the following user stories:
* "As a public user, I should be able to visit a press room that displays an aggregation of all press releases on the website. I expect these to be ordered chronologically and easily searched according to title and topic category."
* "As a public user, I should be able to add a text comment to any press release."
* "As an administrator, I should be able to create new press release pages."

Once again, please note that we have not yet considered wireframes, designs, or implementation details. Those tasks will be completed later.
