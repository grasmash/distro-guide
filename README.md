## Owning a distribution

Before jumping into the details, let's briefly review what you're getting into.

A distribution is a *Software Product* that is used by many *Customers*. Consequently, owning a distribution comes with a great number of responsibilities. 

The distribution owner (i.e. *Product Owner*) is responsible for all of the sites that depend upon the *Product*. They wields the tremendous power to both improve and destroy all of the customer sites in a single action. The most important responsibilities include:

* Identifying and prioritizing defects
* Ensuring that planned changes will not negatively affect existing sites.
* Soliciting feedback to verify that the Product is working as expected, how it is being used, and what its merits and deficiencies are.  

To fulfill these important responsibilities, personnel and processes must be established.
