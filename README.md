## Owning a distribution

Before jumping into the details, let's briefly review what you're getting into.

A distribution is a *Software Product* that is used by many *Customers*. Consequently, owning a distribution comes with a great number of responsibilities. 

The distribution owner (i.e. *Product Owner*) is responsible for all of the sites that depend upon the *Product*. They wield the tremendous power to both improve and destroy all of the customer sites in a single action. The most important responsibilities include:

* Identifying and prioritizing features and defects
* Maintaining application health. E.g., performance, security, etc.
* Facilitating the process of updating existing sites
* Providing documentation and training materials
* Providing a mechanism for soliciting or accepting feedback

The distribution owner should give careful thought to establishing personnel and processes for fulfilling these responsibilities.
