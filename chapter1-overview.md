# What is a distribution?

A Drupal [distribution](https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions) is a tool intended for managing a discrete set of features across more than one Drupal site. Using a distribution makes it possible to quickly set up a complex site. It also permits feature sets to be updated and maintained in a structured way.

For example, an [installation profile for conferences](http://drupal.org/project/cod) might automatically install and configure modules for advanced user registration, attendee profiles, ticketing, and a list of speakers and sessions.

A distribution typically includes the following components:

* An [installation profile](https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions)
* A set of [modules](https://www.drupal.org/glossary#module)
* A [theme](https://www.drupal.org/glossary#theme)
* Third party [libraries](https://www.drupal.org/glossary#library)
* Documentation
