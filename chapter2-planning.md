# Planning a distrubution

* Gather requirements
* Determine a feature set
* Communicate plan

## Gather requirements

As with all projects, you must begin by gathering requirements. In this stage, you're answering the question "What does the distribution need to do?" We strongly recommend using an agile methodology to drive this process. E.g., consider user personas, define requirements as user stories, etc. Some specific suggestions:

* Ask your intended users which features are most important to them.
* Draft requirements from the user perspective
* Consider all user roles/personas. E.g., both the administrative users and the end/public   user.

#### Common mistakes at this stage:

* Defining requirements in a vacuum, without speaking to intended users.
* Designing the wireframes and mockups before gathering requirements.
* Designing the application architecture before gathering requirements
* Defining implementation details rather than requirements. E.g., stating "we need a press release content type" rather than "As a public user, I want to be able to search an archive of press releases."
