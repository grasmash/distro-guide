# Communicate plan

After you gather requirements and formulate a preliminary plan, you must initiate **two way** communication with your intended users. This serves more than one purpose.

* Garner "buy-in" and give users a sense of ownership. This prevents the nightmare scenario of rolling out a distribution that people resist, ignore, or actively attempt to sabotage.
* Allow users to prepare internally.
* Create the opportunity for undiscovered complications and risks to be surfaced.
