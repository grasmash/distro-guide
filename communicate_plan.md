# Communicate plan

After you gather requirements, identify features, and formulate a preliminary plan, you must initiate **two way** communication with your intended users. You should communicate:

* Expected time line.
* Set of expected features, problems these will solve.
* Potential risks and pain points for users.
* A method for receiving feedback and answering questions.


This serves the following purposes:

* Garners "buy-in" and gives users a sense of ownership.
* Allow users to prepare internally.
* Create the opportunity for undiscovered complications and risks to be surfaced.
* Aligns expectations in terms of features, schedule, user responsibilities, etc.

This approach helps to avoid the following common scenarios:

* Users resist, ignore, or actively attempt to sabotage adoption of the distribution
* Major new requirements are discovered late in the development process
* Development work is thrown-away because it does not meet real world requirements
* Adoption is severely hampered by ill-prepared users

For very large organizations, it may be worthwhile to identify particularly influencial or persnickety users and invite them to become part of an "Advisory Committee." This committee can serve as a sounding board and provide these users with a sense of ownership or simply a sense of catharsis when necessary.
