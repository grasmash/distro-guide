# Maintaining a distribution

As the name implies, a distribution is intended to be distributed and implemented by many sites. It is a software product. Consequently, the maintainer of a distribution has the responsibilities of a product owner. 

Distribution maintainers typically have the following responsibilities: 

* Ensuring that the _installation process_ is fully automated and functional.
* Ensuring that all features and processes are _adequately documented_.
* Providing an upgrade path. E.g., for _security vulnerabilities_, updates, new features, or changes to existing features.
* Providing a mechanism for soliciting or accepting feedback. E.g., bug reports, feature requests, etc.

From a project management standpoint, developing and maintaining a Drupal distribution is vastly different that developing a single Drupal site.
